## Issues

Report bugs and suggest enhancements in issues.

## Pull requests

Pull requests introducing new features/enhancements won’t get merged for the most part. They’re very appreciated, just be aware that it probably won’t result in your name getting in GitHub’s contributor list.

The reason for this is that this project is more *cathedral* than *bazaar*, meaning I do most of it on my own (it wouldn’t work otherwise). The reason for this is that for each feature I think about ease of use, documentation, marketing (those three are intertwined) and maintenance. The code ends up being just a tiny part of it.

## About the pull requests and bugs languishing

I have been slacking quite a bit this past year (as of February 2015) on this project. Sorry about that. I have an awful lot of things planned for InstantClick and all my todos/ideas (I have hundreds) were disseminated in multiple digital places, then I didn’t know where to start anymore. It’s all in my Trello now, I hope this will resolve the slacking problem.
